	      Standalone program, multi file, with modules
	      ============================================


This  example  builds  a   single  standalone  program,  without  shared
libraries.  The  source code is  composed by compilation units  with the
following dependency, directed acyclic, graph:

                             --------------
                 ---------->| (unit alpha) |<----------
           uses |            --------------            | uses
                |                                      |
          -------------                         --------------
         | (unit beta) |                       | (unit delta) |
          -------------                         --------------
                ^                                      ^
           uses |                                      | uses
                |            --------------            |
                 -----------| (unit gamma) |-----------
                             --------------
                                    ^
                                    | uses
                                    |
                                 ------
                                | main |
                                 ------

each compilation unit is in a  source file.  Notice that unit "main" the
main one, so:

* It does not declare itself as UNIT, it just declares its USES.

* Its invoke code is the last evaluated one.
