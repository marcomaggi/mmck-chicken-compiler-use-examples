		       Expand-time shared library
		       ==========================


This example builds two shared libraries and a test program; the library
"run-time" loads  the library "expand-time"  to use its features  in its
visit code; the test program loads the "run-time" library.

  Each library has  a single source file and a  single compilation unit;
each compilation unit declares itself as UNIT; none declares a USES.

  The program  has a single source  file and a single  compilation unit;
being the only one: it does not declare a UNIT.

  Each library has its code in a module: the module name equals the unit
name and the library file name.   Every module in the libraries requires
the emission of a module's import library; if module B imports module A:
the compiler dynamically  links itself (through dlopen)  with the import
library of module A to compile module B.

  The program's compilation  unit has its code in a  module "main"; this
module is never imported, so:

* It does not require the emission of an import library.

* It exports  no syntactic  bindings, relying on  the evaluation  of its
  invoke code to start the program.
