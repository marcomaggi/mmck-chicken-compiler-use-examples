	      Standalone program, multi file, with modules
	      ============================================


This  example  builds  a   single  standalone  program,  without  shared
libraries.  The  source code is  composed by compilation units  with the
following dependency, directed acyclic, graph:

                             --------------
                 ---------->| (unit alpha) |<----------
           uses |            --------------            | uses
                |                                      |
          -------------                         --------------
         | (unit beta) |                       | (unit delta) |
          -------------                         --------------
                ^                                      ^
           uses |                                      | uses
                |            --------------            |
                 -----------| (unit gamma) |-----------
                             --------------
                                    ^
                                    | uses
                                    |
                                 ------
                                | main |
                                 ------

each  compilation  unit is  in  a  single  source  file.  The  order  of
evaluation  of each  unit's invoke  code  is established  by the  unit's
dependency  graph.  Notice  that  unit "main"  is the  main  one of  the
standalone program, so:

* It does not declare itself as UNIT, it just declares its USES.

* Its invoke code is the last evaluated one.

  Each compilation unit has its code in a module: the module name equals
the unit  name.  Every module,  but "main",  requires the emission  of a
module's  import library;  if module  B imports  module A:  the compiler
dynamically links  itself (through  dlopen) with  the import  library of
module A to compile module B.

  The  dependency   graph  between  modules  matches   the  one  between
compilation units.  The module "main" is never imported, so:

* It does not require the emission of an import library.

* It exports  no syntactic  bindings, relying on  the evaluation  of its
  invoke code to start the program.
