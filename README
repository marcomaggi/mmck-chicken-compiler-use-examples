1. Introduction
---------------

This  project is  a collection  of usage  examples for  the compiler  of
CHICKEN:  a Scheme-to-C  compiler  supporting the  language features  as
defined in the "Revised^5 Report on Scheme".

  The last  time the author  bothered to  update this paragraph,  he had
tested CHICKEN version 5.0.0.

  Every  example is  in its  own  subdirectory.  All  the makefiles  are
written to  support parallelism, so  we could always compile  an example
with:

   $ make -j3 all

  The makefile rules implemented are  the traditional "all", "clean" and
"check".   The  rule  "check"  will run  the  executable  programs.   In
addition,  the rule  "clean-no-progs" will  remove all  the intermediate
files and shared  libraries, but it will leave  the executable programs:
this is  to check that,  when building standalone programs,  the program
itself is independent from anything else.
